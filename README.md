* url - url of image, for example: <https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/madame-moitessier/hQFUe-elM1npbw>
* size (px) - maximum size. Downloaded image will be NOT exact size as *size*, but close enough.

## Output

outputs/image_name.jpg

## Problems
1. chromedriver executable needs to be in PATH

You can download ChromeDriver here: <https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads> .
Then you have multiple options:

* add it to your system path
* put it in the same directory as your python script
* specify the location directly via executable_path
driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='C:/path/to/chromedriver.exe')
